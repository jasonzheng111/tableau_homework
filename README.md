This is the homework for tableau.


The dashboard summarized the NY citi-rides during the first half of 2020. There are 137, 967 rides in total, with 100,550 of them from annual subscribers. Riders cover a comprehensive range of age, with a slightly higher concentration in male than others in gender.

 

The pandemic impact ridership as ride volume decreased 64% in April compared to January 2020. However, the recovery has been strong since May and in June it reached almost 1.5 times that in January. Considering start time and ride duration, the recovery is likely to be driven by recreational purpose than commuting need.

 

The most popular station before the pandemic is Grove St PATH, with the highest volume as both start and end station. But in Q2, Liberty Light Rail and Newport Pkwy exceeded Grove St PATH to be top stations for rides.

 

Riders tend to start during commute hours on weekdays and late mid-day on weekends. But the pattern is altered by the pandemic where the morning commute need is reduced during weekdays. The duration of rides was 13 minutes on average in Q1 and increased to 38 minutes in Q2. The duration is generally shorter during morning commute hours compared to other times in a day.
